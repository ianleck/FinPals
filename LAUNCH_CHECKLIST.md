## 🚀 Pre-Launch Optimizations

### 1. **Database Indexes** (Performance)
Add these indexes for better query performance:

```sql
-- Speed up expense queries
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_group_created ON expenses(group_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_paid_by ON expenses(paid_by);

-- Speed up balance calculations
CREATE INDEX idx_expense_splits_expense ON expense_splits(expense_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_settlements_group ON settlements(group_id);

-- Speed up member lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_group_members_group ON group_members(group_id, active);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
```

### 2. **Bot Commands Setup**
Run this after deployment to set commands:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/set-commands
```

### 3. **Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in production:
- `BOT_TOKEN` - Your production bot token
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_API_SECRET_TOKEN` - Secure webhook secret
- `ENV` - Set to "production"

### 4. **Webhook Configuration**
Set webhook after deployment:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://your-worker.workers.dev", "secret_token": "YOUR_SECRET"}'
```

## 📊 Missing Features (Lower Priority)

### From PRD Not Implemented:
1. **Multi-currency support** - Only USD currently
2. **Custom splits** - Only even splits supported
3. **Receipt OCR** - No image processing
4. **Payment app integrations** - Manual settlements only
5. **Recurring expense automation** - Detection only, no auto-add
6. **Reminders** - No automated reminder system
7. **Web dashboard** - Bot-only interface

### Nice-to-Have Features:
1. **Expense templates** - For recurring expenses
2. **Budget warnings** - Alert when exceeding limits
3. **Expense approval** - For large amounts
4. **Split adjustment** - Edit splits after creation
5. **Partial settlements** - Pay part of balance

## 🔧 Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Caching Strategy**
Consider adding KV caching for:
- User data (reduce DB lookups)
- Group member lists
- Recent expenses

### 2. **Query Optimization**
- Batch user lookups in `/add` command
- Use transactions for multi-table operations
- Limit history queries to last 30 days by default

### 3. **Message Optimization**
- Auto-delete confirmation messages after 30s
- Paginated views for all list commands
- Inline buttons instead of new messages

## 🚨 Important Limitations

### Telegram API Constraints:
1. **User Mentions**: Can't resolve @mentions unless user has interacted with bot
2. **Message Editing**: Can only edit bot's own messages
3. **Group Permissions**: Need admin rights for full functionality
4. **Rate Limits**: Telegram has strict rate limits (30 messages/second)

### Database Limits:
1. **D1 Free Tier**: 5GB storage, 5M reads/day, 100k writes/day
2. **Worker Memory**: 128MB limit per request
3. **Execution Time**: 30 second timeout per request

## 📝 User Education

### Quick Start Guide for Groups:
1. Add @FinPalsBot to group
2. Make bot admin (optional but recommended)
3. Everyone sends one message (for tracking)
4. Start with `/add 20 coffee`

### Best Practices:
- Use descriptive expense names for better categorization
- Settle balances regularly to keep things clean
- Review `/summary` monthly for insights
- Use `/personal` in DM for overview
