# FinPals - Telegram Expense Tracking Bot

FinPals is a powerful Telegram bot for managing shared expenses within groups. Built on Cloudflare Workers, it offers smart expense tracking, automatic categorization, and seamless financial management.

## üåü Key Features

- **Smart Expense Splitting** - Add expenses with flexible splits (equal or custom amounts)
- **Real-time Balances** - Track who owes whom instantly  
- **Smart Participant Suggestions** - Remembers common expense groups
- **Trip Management** - Organize expenses by trips or events
- **Personal Budgets** - Set spending limits with alerts (optional DM feature)
- **Expense Templates** - Quick shortcuts for frequent expenses
- **Data Export** - Export as CSV for external analysis

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Add to Telegram
Search for [@FinPalsBot](https://t.me/FinPalsBot) and add to your group.

### 2. How Member Detection Works
‚ÑπÔ∏è **Telegram Limitation**: Bots can only see members who've interacted. FinPals tracks members when they:
- Send any message in the group
- Are mentioned in an expense (`@username`)
- Join after the bot is added

**Quick Setup**: After adding the bot, either:
- Ask everyone to send a quick "Hi", OR
- Just mention them when adding expenses (`/add 50 lunch @john @mary`)

### 3. Start Using
```
/start - Initialize bot in your group
/add 50 lunch - Add a $50 lunch expense
/balance - See who owes whom
/status - See who's enrolled
/help - View all commands
```

## üíª Self-Hosting

### Prerequisites
- Telegram Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
- Cloudflare Account (free tier works)
- Node.js 18+

```bash
# Clone and install
